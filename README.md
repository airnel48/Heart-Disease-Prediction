# Heart Disease Prediction

#### This project explores methods in supervised machine learning for classification. 
#### It is based on the heart disease prediction dataset found in the following Kaggle site: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

## Overview
#### The following is a rough outline of the material covered in this training:
#### - Data exploration
#### - Model building with gridsearch 
#### - Model evaluation with cross-validated ROC curves
#### - Interpretable machine learning with partial dependence plots and Shapley values
#### - Algorithmic bias
